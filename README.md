# Converter
Uses api calls to Apple Music and Spotify to generate a local groundtruth of a users music library and upon running can sync. 


Things to do: 
- Build out functionality for deleted songs (not just superset sync).
- Periodic pings, so we sync in the background. 
- Make SQLite not leak user information.
